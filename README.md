# Mobile Android Project Application

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- An Android device or emulator running Android API level 21 (Lollipop) or higher

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/EricLUT20/Mobile-Course-2024.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository:

    ```sh
    cd Project
    ```

3. **Copy Project Directory to Android Studio Projects**

    Copy the cloned project/Mobile-Project directory to your Android Studio projects directory. This is usually located at:

    - On Windows: `C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AndroidStudioProjects`
    - On macOS: `/Users/<Your-Username>/AndroidStudioProjects`
    - On Linux: `/home/<Your-Username>/AndroidStudioProjects`

    You can copy the directory using your file explorer or terminal. For example, on Unix-based systems:

    ```sh
    cp -r Mobile-Project /path/to/AndroidStudioProjects/
    ```

4. **Open the Project in Android Studio**

    1. Open Android Studio.
    2. Click on `File` -> `Open...`.
    3. Navigate to the `AndroidStudioProjects` directory and select the `Mobile-Project` project.
    4. Click `OK` to open the project.

5. **Build the Project**

    Android Studio will automatically start building the project. If it doesn't, you can manually build it by selecting `Build` -> `Make Project`.

6. **Run the Application on an Emulator**

    1. Ensure you have an Android emulator set up. You can set one up by going to `Tools` -> `AVD Manager` -> `Create Virtual Device`.
    2. Once your emulator is set up, click on the `Run` button (green play button) in Android Studio.
    3. Select your emulator and click `OK` to run the application.
    4. Android Studio should automatically start the application once it is installed. If it doesn't, you can manually start it in the emulator.
